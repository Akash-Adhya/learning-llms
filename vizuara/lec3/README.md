# Lecture 3 - Large Language Models

## Overview
Large language models (LLMs) are developed through pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-training involves training on extensive, diverse datasets, such as Common Crawl, books, and Wikipedia, enabling LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks like translation and summarization without task-specific training. This foundational stage allows models like GPT-3 to handle multiple functions effectively by processing vast amounts of data. Fine-tuning refines these models for specific applications using narrower datasets tailored to particular needs, such as customer service or legal advice. This process enhances model performance for targeted tasks by adapting pre-trained models with labeled data for specific scenarios, ensuring effective real-world application. Pre-training is resource-intensive and costly, while fine-tuning allows organizations to create tailored solutions in sectors like law or finance. Understanding the distinction between these stages is crucial for leveraging LLMs effectively. Future topics will include an introduction to Transformers and practical coding sessions related to these concepts.

## Time stamps wise notes

### 00:00 - 00:05
Large language models (LLMs) are built through two main stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-training involves training on a large and diverse dataset, which enables LLMs to effectively understand and respond to human interactions. For example, GPT-3, a predecessor to GPT-4, was trained on 175 billion parameters using extensive data sources, including 60% from Common Crawl, which contains a vast repository of internet data. This foundational training allows LLMs to generate accurate responses based on the extensive information they have processed.

### 00:05 - 00:10
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are trained on vast datasets, including over 67 billion words from books and 3 billion from Wikipedia, totaling around 300 billion tokens. Initially, LLMs were trained for word completion tasks, but it was found that they could perform a variety of other tasks, such as translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis, without specific training for those tasks. This capability arises from the extensive pre-training on diverse data, allowing a single model to handle multiple functions effectively. For instance, an application can generate multiple-choice questions on various topics without being explicitly trained for that purpose, demonstrating the versatility of pre-trained LLMs.

### 00:10 - 00:15
Pre-training involves training a large language model (LLM) on extensive data to perform a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning is necessary for specific applications, as it refines the model using a narrower dataset tailored to particular needs. For instance, an airline company developing a chatbot would require fine-tuning to ensure responses are relevant to its services, rather than generic answers from pre-trained models. Examples include SK Telecom, which improved customer service interactions through fine-tuning for telecom-related conversations, and Harvey, an AI tool for attorneys that needed specialized training on legal case history to be effective.

### 00:15 - 00:20
Building AI tools for specific sectors, such as law or finance, requires fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with relevant data, like legal case histories or proprietary company information. Pre-training, also known as foundational modeling, involves training on vast datasets, which can be costly and resource-intensive; for instance, the pre-training cost for GPT-3 was approximately $4.6 million. Fine-tuning allows organizations to create tailored applications, enhancing the model's performance for specific tasks. The process consists of three main steps: data collection, pre-training, and fine-tuning, each requiring significant computational power and investment.

### 00:20 - 00:25
Pre-training and fine-tuning are two distinct stages in the development of large language models (LLMs). Pre-training involves training on a large corpus of unlabeled text data using unsupervised learning techniques, where the model predicts the next word in a sentence. In contrast, fine-tuning is performed on labeled data to adapt the model for specific tasks, such as classification or translation, by providing examples with predefined labels. This process enhances the model's capabilities for particular applications, ensuring it performs effectively in real-world scenarios. Understanding the difference between these stages is crucial for effectively interacting with LLMs like GPT.

### 00:25 - 00:30
Instruction fine-tuning involves using labeled datasets to refine models for specific tasks, such as customer support responses or email classification. Pre-training requires a large corpus of diverse data and significant computational resources, while fine-tuning typically necessitates labeled data to enhance model performance on targeted applications like classification, summarization, and translation. Companies often engage in fine-tuning rather than relying solely on foundational models, which is a more costly process. Future lectures will cover an introduction to Transformers and the "Attention is All You Need" paper, leading into practical coding sessions.

## Summarization 
Pre-training is the foundational stage where models are trained on enormous and diverse datasets, such as Common Crawl (internet data), books, and Wikipedia. For instance, GPT-3 was trained on 175 billion parameters using roughly 300 billion tokens, which included over 67 billion words from books and 3 billion from Wikipedia. This stage enables LLMs to understand and generate human-like text and perform a wide range of tasks—like translation, summarization, or sentiment analysis—without being explicitly trained on those specific tasks. This versatility comes from the model’s exposure to vast, varied information.

Fine-tuning, on the other hand, adapts these general-purpose models for specific real-world applications. It involves training on smaller, domain-specific datasets that are labeled for particular tasks. For example, an airline company may fine-tune a model to handle customer service queries, ensuring the chatbot provides accurate, relevant responses instead of generic ones. Real-world applications include SK Telecom's customer interaction models and Harvey, an AI tool tailored for legal professionals through training on legal case data.

While pre-training is extremely resource-intensive—GPT-3’s pre-training reportedly cost around $4.6 million—it provides a strong general-purpose model. Fine-tuning is more cost-effective and practical for organizations aiming to solve industry-specific problems. It involves supervised learning where labeled examples are used to refine the model's outputs for specialized tasks such as classification, translation, or customer support.

Understanding the distinction between pre-training and fine-tuning is critical for effectively applying LLMs. It allows organizations to strike a balance between leveraging the general power of foundational models and tailoring them for maximum effectiveness in particular scenarios.

Upcoming lectures will delve into Transformer architectures—the backbone of modern LLMs—starting with the "Attention is All You Need" paper, followed by hands-on coding sessions to reinforce these concepts.
