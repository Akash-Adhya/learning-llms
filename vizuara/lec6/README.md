# Lecture 6 - Stages of building an LLM

There are 3 stages of building an LLM from scratch

## Stage 1 - **Basic LLM or Building an LLM**

- **Data collection, preprocessing and sampling**
- **Attention mechanism**
- **LLM architecture**

Tokenization
Vector Embedding

    - positional embedding

Batch normalization

    - contextual embedding
    - Data batching sequences

## Stage 2 - Pretraining LLM

Build a Foundational Model

    - pretraining a model on unlabelled data

Model Evaluation

Load Pretrained Weights

## Stage 3 - Finetuning LLM

Finetuning a model on labelled data

Making some projects

    - Classifier
    - Chatbot
